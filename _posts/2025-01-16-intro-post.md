# They say the best time to plant a seed is 20 years ago...

Spoiler: That seed would've grown into a tree that made the paper we print technical documentation on.

## Writing about technical concepts can improve our perspective on the 'why' behind our implementation choices and problem-solving approach in software engineering.

I've learned that a shift in my cognitive approach can easily be the difference between a less-than-productive several hours spent troubleshooting an issue for a workaround that wasn't necessary in the first place and the oh-so-desirable flow state that automatically parses out unnecessary information, allowing one to focus on the essential details to Get The Job Done.

Of course, the job is never done; that's part of the appeal. The concept of 'continual improvement' isn't unique to technical work. In my time working as a contractor for Amazon, it was my baseline mode of operation. It served me well as the primary facilitator of cross-functional teams: IT managers, 3rd party customer success managers, legal, facilities, etc. Even when a product has achieved the ideal output, if you ask 5 people, you'll find at least another few edge cases that may have not happened this week but are non-trivial nonetheless and should be documented.

If you couldn't tell, Iâ€™m a (proud) nerd... especially for operationalizing business requirements into technical products to help people work together effectively. This blog-documentation site's aim is two-fold, (1) to serve as my safe space to refine unformulated thoughts so I can (2) deliver information to readers who might be overwhelmed learning new technical concepts. I find writing therapeutic and hope these docs help other life-long learners in the world of software engineering.

Cheers!
